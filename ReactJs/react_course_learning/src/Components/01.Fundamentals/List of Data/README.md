Exercise: Rendering a List of Data with .map()
In this exercise, you will learn how to render a list of items using the .map() method in JSX.

Step 1: Create a UserList Component
Create a new file called UserList.jsx.

Inside this file, create a functional component called UserList.

In the component, create a users array with the following objects, where each object represents a user with id, name, and age:

const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie", age: 22 },
];
Use the .map() method to render a list of users. Each user's name and age should be displayed inside a <div> element. Use the id as the unique key for each list item.

Step 2: Create a ProductList Component
Create a new file called ProductList.jsx.

Inside this file, create a functional component called ProductList.

Create a products array with the following objects, where each object represents a product with id, name, and price:

const products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Phone", price: "$699" },
  { id: 2, name: "Laptop", price: "$1200" },
  { id: 3, name: "Headphones", price: "$199" },
];
Use the .map() method to render the list of products. Each productâ€™s name and price should be displayed inside a <div> element. Use the id as the key for each product.

Step 3: Render the Components in App.jsx
In your App.jsx file, import the UserList and ProductList components:

import UserList from "./UserList";
import ProductList from "./ProductList";
Inside the App component's return statement, render both the UserList and ProductList components:

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserList />
      <ProductList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
