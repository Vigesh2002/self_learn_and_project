Exercise: Using Dynamic Content with {} in JSX
In this exercise, you'll learn how to inject dynamic data into JSX using curly braces {}.

Step 1: Create a Greeting Component
Create a new file called Greeting.jsx.

Inside this file, create a functional component named Greeting.

The Greeting component should return a <div> containing:

A <h1> element that dynamically displays a greeting message.
A <p> element that dynamically displays the current date.
Use JavaScript expressions inside {} to dynamically render the following:

A name variable containing a name, such as "John".
A new Date() object to display the current date.
Step 2: Create a ProductInfo Component
Create a new file called ProductInfo.jsx.

Inside this file, create a functional component named ProductInfo.

The ProductInfo component should return a <div> that dynamically displays product details:

Use a product object that contains the following properties:
name: "Laptop",
price: $1200,
availability: "In stock"
Display the product name, price, and availability using {}.

Step 3: Render Components in App.jsx
In your App.jsx file, import the Greeting and ProductInfo components:

import Greeting from "./Greeting";
import ProductInfo from "./ProductInfo";
Inside the App component's return statement, render both components:

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
      <ProductInfo />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
